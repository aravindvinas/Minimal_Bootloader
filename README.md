# Minimal_Bootloader
***WARNING NOT TESTED***

This project aims to create a robust bootloader for STM32 using ST's HAL and binary loader from PC. As of now loader program is completed and bootloader is a barebones one, without any means to check for proper CRC and proper flash read and writes. Next target is to make it more robust and fail-proof with a good communication with the host.
